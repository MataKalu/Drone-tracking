# Drone-tracking
Method for drone tracking using Kalman Filters family, RL and ML. 


**Features:
1. trajectory function + PDF doc.
2. RL code example for spiral EKF + full RL method and flow and optimization results as a PDF doc.
3. MATLAB gui with full implementation code of IMM,UKF,EKF and KF for spiral and const acceleration motion models (after RL ooptimization) with recomended Q elements values.
4. Pole Cllasification error estimator - code (jupyter notbook) + mathematics and outputs PDF doc. 
5. Full IMM implementation .m file with full analysis.
